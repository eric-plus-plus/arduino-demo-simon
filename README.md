# arduino-demo-simon
An intro lesson for Arudino centered around making a clone of the Simon game

This was created for the electrical subteam of the Sooner Rover Team at the University of Oklahoma to give new members a crash course on microcontrollers. Feel free to use/modify the code and its documentation for your own purposes.
